# personal-portfolio
In this project, I've created the following:

A -> Home Page
A home page with an image, and a singular section to introduce briefly introduce myself.

B -> About Page
An about page with three hobbies of mine to potentially gain the interest of employers.

C -> Portfolio Page
A portfolio page with three project placeholders for future projects to go.

D -> Navigation + Contact Bar
A navigation bar to navigate throughout the website and a contact bar at the footer with three placeholder contact links. All equipped with a hovering effect that'll turn the text from white to blue.
